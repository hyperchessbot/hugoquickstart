# What is *Hyper Bot* ?

In short [Hyper Bot](https://github.com/hyperchessbot/hyperbot) is a Javascript program that can play on [lichess](https://lichess.org) as a [bot](https://lichess.org/api#tag/Bot).

It is designed for easy deployment on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), which is a cloud application platform.

Once deployed to Heroku, your bot will accept challenges and play games without having to keep a browser page or a console window open in your computer.
